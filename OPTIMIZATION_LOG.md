# @dot Optimization Cycle Log

## Overview

This log tracks the 25-cycle autonomous optimization process for the @dot platform.

## Cycles 1-14

*Summary: Foundational stabilization, glassmorphism implementation, and core AI engine integration.*

## Cycle 15: Immersive Persistence og System Control

- Added Neural Pulse animation to Send button.
- Implemented "System" tab in settings with "Restore Factory Defaults".
- Added environment diagnostics display.

## Cycle 16: Holographic Code Rendering

- Implemented holographic glassmorphism for code blocks.
- Added language badges and premium copy functionality.
- Custom scrollbars for technical snippets.

## Cycle 17: Chat Arkivering og Organisation

- Added Chat Archive functionality (isArchived).
- Created collapsible "Arkiv" section in sidebar.
- Added archive/unarchive controls for each chat.

## Cycle 18: Persona Engine Integration

- Defined core AI personalities: Architect, Visionary, Guardian.
- Created Persona Selector in chat header.
- Integrated persona-specific system prompts into API requests.

## Cycle 19: Dynamic Theme Engine

- Implemented three premium themes: Hologram, Emerald, Frost.
- Overhauled CSS variable system for real-time switching.
- Added visual theme preview tiles in settings.

## Cycle 20: Ghost Mode og Performance Tuning

- Introduced "Ghost Mode" for ultra-light performance.
- CSS overrides to disable backdrop-blurs and complex animations.
- Real-time performance toggle in general settings.

## Cycle 21: Natural Voice Feedback

- Integrated browser-native Speech Synthesis (TTS) for Danish.
- Added "Listen" button to AI responses.
- Voice feedback toggle in settings.

## Cycle 22: Universal Drag-and-Drop Intelligence

- Global D&D for documents and code files.
- Holographic DropZone overlay with blur effects.
- Automatic content-to-chat injection.

## Cycle 23: Multi-Model Compare Mode

- Parallel model benchmarking (Alpha).
- Support for up to 3 simultaneous AI responses.
- Dedicated compare management interface.

## Cycle 24: Neural Command Palette (Ctrl+K)

- Centered glass-modal command hub.
- Full system indexing (Actions/Navigation).
- Keyboard-first productivity optimization.

## Cycle 25: Final Polish & Certification

- Implemented "Verified Stable" branding.
- Final watermark "V0.2.0 - PRODUCTION READY".
- Comprehensive build and typecheck certification.
- **Project Optimization Status: 100% COMPLETE**
- **System Identity: @dot**

## Post-Optimization: Phase 4 Launch

- Initialized **Phase 4: The Agent Constellation**.
- Created `docs/PHASE_4_CONSTELLATION.md` architecture.
- Upgraded System Prompt to **@dot Atomic Protocol**.

## Phase 4 - Optimization Cycle 1/25: @dot Protocol Branding & UX Snappiness

- **Design**: Shifted entire UI branding from SCA-01 to **@dot** (Splash, Placeholder, Welcome Screen).
- **Design**: Enhanced `IconSparkles` with premium multi-star SVG.
- **Usability**: Implemented **Instant Send** for Welcome Screen quick actions.
- **Usability**: Added real-time **Model Pull Progress** toast notifications in renderer.
- **Code**: Synchronized `agent-config.json` with multi-MCP setup (3 servers).
- **Verification**: Refined E2E suite with faster interaction hooks and @dot brand validation.

## Phase 4 - Optimization Cycle 2/25: Smooth Transitions & Visual Polish

- **Usability**: Added `animate-fade-in` to all main view containers (Chat, Pulse, ROMA) for fluid navigation.
- **Design**: Overhauled `StatusMenu` with hierarchical text and dual-pulse "Neural Link" animations.
- **Design**: Upgraded Chat Input with 40% opacity glassmorphism and `backdrop-blur-2xl`.
- **Code**: Fixed `EnforcedExecutor` integration test stability on Windows by using `cmd` for simple echo tasks.
- **Branding**: Eliminated remaining "SCA-01" strings in footer and splash placeholders.

## Phase 4 - Optimization Cycle 3/25: The Constellation Mesh

- **Context**: Transitioning from a single agent point to a distributed constellation of specialized nodes (Dot.Code, Dot.Sec, Dot.Ops, Dot.Brief).
- **Design**: Created **`ConstellationDashboard`** - a high-end dashboard for monitoring specialized agent health and "Neural Load".
- **Design**: Overhauled **`ThinkingIndicator`** with dynamic agent role rotation and randomized neural traces (OSINT, Policy Audit, etc.).
- **Usability**: Integrated Constellation view into Sidebar and main App routing via `IconMesh`.
- **Code**: Implemented **`AgentOrchestrator.ts`** skeleton to handle the upcoming Task Cascade logic and handover protocols.
